# Drug Review Machine Learining app

Application developed during the Digital House Data Science 2021 course 

This app extracts tweets and post from Reddit using their respective APIs , runs an analysis using a LGBM model trained with this dataset :

https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018

and gives statistics about the Medical drug in that social media site.

## Example:

During the COVID-19 pandemic a really popular medication was the Dexamethasone , specially for patients in critical condition.

In this example we run the app for this drug and searching in RedditÂ´s r/all ( a subreddit with the most popular posts from multiple subreddits)

After running the model this are our final results:

As we can see there is a spike of interest during the firsts months of 2020 , when the pandemic started.

We also generate a Wordcloud of all the collected posts.
